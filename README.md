# Nodejs-Influx
Catchpoint Integration with InfluxDB
---
InfluxDB works really well with observability tools like Grafana and more. We can use this integration to pull timeseries data from Catchpoint and store it in influxDB so that we can plot similar dashboards as Catchpoint.

This integration makes use of a Node.js script that runs at 15 minutes intervals to pull raw performance chart data from the Catchpoint GET: LastRaw API. It can be used to retrieve and store data for a list of tests in the same division. 

## Prerequisites
1. NodeJS v16.x
2. [InfluxDB v2.x](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.1/install/?t=Linux)
3. Catchpoint account with a REST API consumer

## Installation and Configuration
1. Copy the Nodejs-Influx folder to your machine
2. Run npm install in the directory /Nodejs-Influx

### Configuration
1. In the config_catchpoint.js file under config sub-directory, enter your [Catchpoint API consumer key and secret](https://portal.catchpoint.com/ui/Content/Administration/ApiDetail.aspx)
2. In the tests object of the config_catchpoint.js file, enter the Test IDs you want to pull the data for in an array format. Please ensure to enter only the Test ID in the array belonging to the respective Test Type.

*Example:*

---
    tests: 
    {
        web: [142613,142614,142615,142616],
        transaction: [142602,142603],
        api: [142683,142689,155444],
        ping: [142600],
        traceroute: [142607,142608,142609],
        dns: [942639,142640,142641],
        websocket: [842700],
        smtp: [142604]
    }

---
- In the config_influx.js file, enter your [Influx API token](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/create-token/)
- In the same config_influx.js file, enter your InfluxDB organization name, bucket name, url and measurement name where the data will be stored. Note that the organization and bucket should be created after installation of InfluxDB. The default Influx URL is http://localhost:8086

## How to run
- In the /Nodejs-Influx directory, run `node insert_db.js` after uncommenting the `var interval=setInterval(run,900000)` and commenting out the `run()` line in the same file

**or**

- Create a cronjob to run the insert_db.js script every 15 minutes.

*Example crontab entry, if the file resides in /usr/local/bin/insert_db.js*

`*/15 * * * * cd /usr/local/bin/ && node /usr/local/bin/insert_db.js > /usr/local/bin/logs/cronlog.log 2>&1`

**Note: Ensure that influx service is running**

Once the script starts running and data is inserted into InfluxDB, it can queried using [Flux queries](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.1/query-data/execute-queries/influx-api/) or visualized in graphs by opening the [Influx Data Explorer](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/query-data/execute-queries/data-explorer/).
